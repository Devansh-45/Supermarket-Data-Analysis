## Introduction
This project analyzes supermarket data using K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) techniques. The goal is to gain insights into customer segmentation and patterns within the dataset.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the [Ecommerce Dataset for Predictive Marketing 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hunter0007/ecommerce-dataset-for-predictive-marketing-2023) from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about customer transactions, including product details, purchase history, and customer demographics.

## Dependencies
The following libraries were used in this project:
- NumPy 🧮
- Pandas 🐼
- Seaborn 🌊
- Matplotlib 📊
- Sklearn 💻

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned and prepared for analysis. Missing values and outliers were handled appropriately.

2. Feature Engineering: Relevant features were selected and transformed if needed. Feature scaling was performed as part of the data preparation process.

3. K-means Clustering: The K-means algorithm was applied to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The optimal number of clusters was determined using techniques such as the elbow method or silhouette score.

4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA was used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining the most important information. This helped visualize the data and identify the key factors driving customer segmentation.

5. Data Visualization: The results of the analysis were visualized using various charts and plots to provide clear insights into customer segments and patterns.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: **[Supermarket-Data-Analysis ](https://github.com/Devansh-45/Supermarket-Data-Analysis)**
2. Install the required dependencies:

		pip install -r [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Devansh-45/Supermarket-Data-Analysis/blob/master/requirements.txt)
  
3. Prepare  the  dataset. Download  the  [Ecommerce Dataset for Predictive Marketing 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hunter0007/ecommerce-dataset-for-predictive-marketing-2023) from Kaggle and place it in the project directory.  

4. Run the main script:  [supermarket-dataset-analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/Devansh-45/Supermarket-Data-Analysis/blob/master/Notebooks/supermarket-dataset-analysis.ipynb)

This will run the main script and perform the data analysis, including K-means clustering and PCA. 


5. Explore the results. Once the script completes, you can explore the results through the generated visualizations and console outputs. The analysis may provide insights into customer segments, relationships between segments, and key factors driving customer segmentation.

Feel free to customize the project or modify the code to suit your specific needs. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please don't hesitate to reach out for support.

## Results
The analysis provided valuable insights into customer segments and patterns within the supermarket dataset. Some potential findings include:

- Identification of distinct customer clusters based on purchasing behavior.
- Visualization of the relationships between different customer segments.
- Understanding of the key factors driving customer segmentation.

## Future Enhancements
Here are some ideas to further enhance the project:

- Implementing other clustering algorithms and comparing their results with K-means.
- Building predictive models to forecast customer behavior or predict future sales.
- Developing a web-based dashboard or interactive visualization tool for exploring the analysis results.
